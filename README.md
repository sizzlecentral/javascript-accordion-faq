# javascript-accordion-faq
This is a simple javascript accordion for FAQs, feel free to employ it for business or personal use.

Instructions:

1. Make sure the .css and .js files are linked properly to the html file you want the accordion for.
2. Each button should have the class "acc-question", as well as a unique id.
3. Each answer should have teh class "acc-content", as well as a unique id.
4. The onClick attribute of each button calls the "toggle" function in the .js file, which takes two arguments - the id of the question, and the id of the answer.
5. Style to taste and enjoy!
